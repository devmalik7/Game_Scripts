# Flappy Bird Game

## Game Details
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:** The Flappy Bird game in Python is an arcade-style game where the player controls a bird that must fly between moving pipes without hitting them. The player taps or presses a key to make the bird flap and stay airborne while gravity constantly pulls it downward. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible to earn points, making it a fun way to practice Python game development concepts like animation, collision detection, and event handling using libraries such as Pygame.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Python/Flappy-Bird
