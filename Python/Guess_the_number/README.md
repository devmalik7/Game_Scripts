# Guess The Number 

A fun console-based game where you try to guess the number chosen by the computer!

## How to Play
1. Choose a difficulty level:
   - **Easy:** Range 1–10, 5 attempts  
   - **Medium:** Range 1–50, 7 attempts  
   - **Hard:** Range 1–100, 10 attempts  

2. The computer picks a random number within the chosen range.  
3. You try to guess it! After each guess, you’ll get hints — “Too high” or “Too low”.  
4. Win if you guess correctly before running out of attempts.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 guess_the_number.py
