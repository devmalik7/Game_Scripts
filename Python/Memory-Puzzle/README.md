# Memory Puzzle Game

## Game Details
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:** The Memory Puzzle game in Python is a matching game that tests the player’s concentration and recall skills. A grid of hidden tiles is displayed, each containing a symbol or image underneath. The player flips two tiles at a time — if they match, they remain visible; if not, they turn back over. The goal is to match all pairs in the fewest moves possible. This game helps practice Python concepts like loops, lists, event handling, and graphical programming using Pygame or Tkinter.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
