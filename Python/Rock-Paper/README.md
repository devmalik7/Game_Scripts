# Rock,Paper,Scissor Game

## Game Details
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:** The Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python is a simple program where the player competes against the computer by choosing either rock, paper, or scissors. The computer makes a random choice, and the winner is decided based on the classic rules — rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. It’s an easy and fun project to practice Python basics like conditionals, loops, and random number generation.
