# Blackjack (Python)

A console-based version of the classic **Blackjack** card game!  
Try to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible — but don’t go over, or you’ll bust!

---

## How to Play
1. You and the dealer each get two cards.  
2. On your turn, you can:
   - **Hit** → draw another card  
   - **Stand** → keep your total and end your turn  
3. The dealer will reveal their cards and draw until reaching 17 or higher.  
4. The closest total to 21 wins!  
   - Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10  
   - Ace (A) = 1 or 11, whichever benefits you more.
